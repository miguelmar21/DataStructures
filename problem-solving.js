/** 1: Understand the problem
 * - Can i restate the problem in my own words?
 * - What are the inputs/outputs of the problem?
 * - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
 */

/** 2: Exploring concrete examples
 * - Write a functoin which takes in a string and returns counts of each character 
 * - in the string.
 * - charCount("hello") // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
 * - Maybe we should add each letter of the alphabet and just incrament each time u see it?
 * - These are questions that u should be asking
*/

/** 3: Break it down
 * - Take steps of the problem and write them down
 * - Basically psuedocode
 * - Just write the basic solution of your problem
 */

/** 4. Solve or simplify
 * If you can't solve it completely, solve a simplper problem
 * Instead of getting stuck on one really hard problem, its much better to just 
 * start writing code where you can incorperate that harder problem in later
 * To do this, find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
 * Ignore that difficulty, write a simplified solution and then incorperate that 
 * difficulty back into your code 
 */

/** 5. Look back and refactor
 * Sure it works, but can you improve your code? Can you make it more efficient?
 * What do you not like about how the code reads?
 * Maybe fix the legibility
