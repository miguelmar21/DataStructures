Keep in mind that the first three sorting algos -- bubble, insertion, and selection are all pretty bad in large data sets. These ONLY excel in small data sets so think about that before you utilize these.

The other three are very good when used for large data sets :) But they're also a crap ton harder to implement. These can improve time complexity from O(n2) to O(n log n)
