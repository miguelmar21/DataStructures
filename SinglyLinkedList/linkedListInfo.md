- List of data
- Consists of a bunch of elements with no indices which are just pointing to other elements
- Contains a head, tail, and length property
- Consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
- A skyscraper with only stairs, no elevator
- Random access is not allowed, if we ask for 10th element we cannot just go there,
we have to traverse through the whole list

- Are excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beggining are frequently required
- Arrays contain built in index whereas Linked List do not
- The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues
